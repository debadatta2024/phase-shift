# Jeevan Jyothi - AI Medical Report Simplifier ü©∫

Jeevan Jyothi ("Light of Life") is a web application designed to demystify complex medical lab reports for the average person. Users can sign up, paste the text from their medical reports (like a Complete Blood Count or Lipid Profile), and receive a simple, color-coded explanation of what each value means in plain English.

This project was built from the ground up, featuring a secure backend with user authentication and a dynamic, responsive frontend built with React.
